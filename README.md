# SanSilvestrerace2016

Inference.R: I make inference from San Silvestre 2016 dataset to a Gamma distribution and calculate differente probabilities for each runner based on their times. pdf.jpeg is the probability density function and cdf.jpeg is the cumulative density function.

inference.py: I make inference from San Silvestre 2016 dataset by categorie. Gaussian and Gamma distribution are used. We want to estimate probability to finish race in 5000 seconds and which changes should be done for get it. It is shown pdf and cdf of each category and reduced run out of time probability. Also it is represented simple and cdf run out of time in order to explain final decision of dropping four categories. Another solution is to manage two races, first one shorter than 5000 seconds and another for rest of categories.
